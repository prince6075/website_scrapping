# website_scrapping
Description:

Developed a web data scraper using Selenium and Python to extract specific information from websites and store it in a structured format (CSV file). This project demonstrates my ability to:

Utilize Selenium: Effectively interacted with web elements, navigated dynamic content, and extracted desired data.
Handle data processing: Cleaned and organized extracted data, ensuring its accuracy and usability.
Work independently: Defined the target website, identified relevant data points, and built the scraper from scratch.
Technical Skills:

Python 3
Selenium
Data extraction & processing
Automation
Key Features (Optional): 

Scraped data from [website name] (or similar) to collect information like [list specific data points].
Implemented robust error handling to manage dynamic content and potential website changes.
Automated the entire scraping process, making it repeatable and scalable.
